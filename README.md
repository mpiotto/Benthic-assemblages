Joint species distribution modelling of Antarctic benthic assemblages

This repository contains the data, metadata, and model implementation used to analyse temporal and depth-related patterns in benthic community assembly in Potter Cove (Antarctica). The analysis is based on a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) implemented under the Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) framework.

The model integrates species occurrence and abundance (percent cover) data with environmental variables, species functional traits, and phylogenetic relationships to infer the ecological filtering processes shaping benthic assemblages through time.

Datasets are available in the Data/ folder, and the model implementation is provided in the Model/ folder. Both the data structure and the full model specification are described in detail in the Supplementary Information of the manuscript.
