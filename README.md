# Benthic-assemblages

Joint species distribution modelling of Antarctic benthic assemblages.

This repository contains the model implementation used to analyse temporal and depth-related patterns in benthic community assembly in Potter Cove (Antarctica). The analysis is based on a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) implemented under the Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) framework.

The model integrates species occurrence and abundance (percent cover) data with environmental variables, species functional traits, and phylogenetic relationships to infer the ecological filtering processes shaping benthic assemblages through time.

Datasets are available at PANGEA repository, and the model implementation is provided in the Model/ folder. Both the data structure and the full model specification are described in detail in the Supplementary Information of the manuscript.

Every script starts explaining the content of the files that you will need to run it. In addition, every script has notes and comments indicating how to use the codes and reproduce the results. However, we strongly suggest your reading the Extended Methods section of the Supplementary Information for further details on the models and to understand how some of the predictions were made.
