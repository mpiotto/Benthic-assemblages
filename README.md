Joint species distribution modelling of Antarctic benthic assemblages

This repository contains the data, metadata, and model implementation used to analyse temporal and depth-related patterns in benthic community assembly in Potter Cove (Antarctica). The analysis is based on a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) implemented under the Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) framework.

The model integrates species occurrence and abundance (percent cover) data with environmental variables, species functional traits, and phylogenetic relationships to infer the ecological filtering processes shaping benthic assemblages through time.

Datasets are available in the Data/ folder, and the model implementation is provided in the Model/ folder. Both the data structure and the full model specification are described in detail in the Supplementary Information of the manuscript.

# Sharing/Access information
Datasets belong to the Laboratorio de Ecosistemas Marinos y Polares (ECOMARES), Instituto de Diversidad y Ecología Animal (IDEA), Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC) - Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONICET). 
Requests to use these data should be addressed to Dr. Ricardo Sahade (rsahade@unc.edu.ar), and Biol. María Piotto (mpiotto@unc.edu.ar).

Every script starts explaining the content of the files that you will need to run it. In addition, every script has notes and comments indicating how to use the codes and reproduce the results. However, we strongly suggest your reading the Extended Methods section of the Supplementary Information for further details on the models and to understand how some of the predictions were made.
